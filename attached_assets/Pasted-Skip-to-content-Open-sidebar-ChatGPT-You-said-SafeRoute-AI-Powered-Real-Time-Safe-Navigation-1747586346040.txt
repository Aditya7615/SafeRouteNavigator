I'll set up a PostgreSQL database for the project. Let me implement the necessary changes to connect your application to the database.

Now I'll setup the database for our application. I'll update the necessary files to use the PostgreSQL database you've added.


Edited server/db.ts
Now I'll update the storage implementation to use the database instead of in-memory storage. Let me modify the necessary files:


Opened server/storage.ts
I'll continue by implementing the database storage class to replace the in-memory storage.


Edited server/storage.ts
I need to fix the database setup by adding the sql import and correcting the import position. Let me update the file:

I understand that the map functionality isn't showing any trace details, heatmap, or lighting information for routes. Let's implement Google Maps integration for finding shortest and safest paths with lighting and other safety details.

First, let's fix our database setup and then update the map component to display safety information:

Let me create a directory for the scripts first and then continue:


Executed mkdir -p scripts
Now I'll create the script to help us push the database schema:


Created scripts/push-db.js
I understand we need to improve the map functionality by adding tracing details, heatmaps, and lighting information for routes. Let's update our application to use Google Maps for finding the shortest path and displaying safety features.


Opened client/src/components/Map.tsx
I see we need to enhance our map component to show more detailed safety information. Let's modify our Map component to include safety overlays and route tracing features.

I'd like to integrate Google Maps for showing detailed safety information along routes. For this, we need a Google Maps API key.

A Google Maps API key will allow us to:

Show detailed route information with safety heatmaps
Display multiple route options (safest vs. shortest)
Show proper lighting conditions along paths
Visualize safety data points on the map
Could you please provide a Google Maps API key? You can get one from the Google Cloud Console (https://console.cloud.google.com/) by enabling the Maps JavaScript API.

I understand you'd like to use free mapping solutions instead of Google Maps API since it's paid. Let's update our implementation to use a free alternative. We can use OpenStreetMap with Leaflet, which is a popular free mapping library.


Installed leaflet, react-leaflet
I see that we had an issue with installing the latest version of react-leaflet due to a React version mismatch. Let's try installing a compatible version:


Installed leaflet, @types/leaflet, react-leaflet@^4.2.1
Great! Now that we have Leaflet installed, which is a free and open-source JavaScript library for mobile-friendly interactive maps, let's update our map component to use Leaflet instead of Google Maps.

Let's modify our Map component to use Leaflet:

I see you want to replace Google Maps with a free alternative. Let's implement OpenStreetMap with Leaflet, which is completely free and open-source.


Opened client/src/components/Map.tsx
I'll create a completely new Map component using Leaflet instead of Google Maps:


Created client/src/components/LeafletMap.tsx
Now I'll update our MapPage to use the new LeafletMap component instead of the Google Maps integration. This will give us free mapping functionality with similar safety visualization features:
